  </section>
  <!-- Section 2: Phase 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>Artemis Capstone Project: Phase 1</h2>

    <p>In the initial phase of the Artemis Capstone Project, our focus is on performing thorough reconnaissance to build a comprehensive profile of Artemis, Incorporated. The primary goal is to gather publicly available information that provides insight into the organization's digital footprint, potential vulnerabilities, and overall security posture.</p>

    <p>As cybersecurity consultants, our team will employ a strategic blend of tools and methods, ranging from advanced Google searches and WHOIS lookups to social media analysis and DNS interrogation. By harnessing these resources, we aim to understand Artemis deeply, ensuring a solid foundation for subsequent phases of the penetration test. This reconnaissance phase not only sets the stage for a successful engagement but also underscores our commitment to delivering tailored cybersecurity solutions that address Artemis' unique challenges and concerns. Let's embark on this crucial first step towards fortifying Artemis against emerging cyber threats.</p>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Google Search:</strong> Use advanced Google searches to find information about Artemis.</li>
      <li><strong>WHOIS Lookup:</strong> Look up domain registration details to understand Artemis' online presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media Check:</strong> Review social media platforms for insights into Artemis' structure and potential risks.</li>

    <h3>Artemis Inc. Vulnerability Assessment</h3>

    <div class="summary">
      <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
      <p>Artemis Inc. recently underwent a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact of internal and external threats. The assessment, conducted from January 2023, focused on identifying vulnerabilities that could compromise the organization's security. The following summary provides a high-level view of the business risks in plain English, ensuring that executives can make informed decisions.</p>

      <h5>Overall Assessment Results:</h5>
      <p>The assessment uncovered critical insights into Artemis Inc.'s cybersecurity posture, highlighting vulnerabilities that could pose significant business risks. The identified vulnerabilities fall into three main risk categories: Critical, High, and Moderate.</p>

      <div class="risk-categories">
        <div class="red">
          <p><strong>Critical Risks (Red):</strong> Immediate action is required to address these vulnerabilities, as they present severe threats that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential network compromise. Failure to address critical risks promptly may result in severe business disruptions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="orange">
          <p><strong>High Risks (Orange):</strong> These vulnerabilities pose substantial risks and require urgent attention. While not as imminent as critical risks, high-risk vulnerabilities could still lead to serious consequences if exploited. Timely remediation is essential to safeguard business operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="yellow">
          <p><strong>Moderate Risks (Yellow):</strong> While not as severe as critical or high risks, moderate-risk vulnerabilities still present potential threats. Managing these risks is important for overall cybersecurity resilience. A proactive approach is recommended to prevent escalation into more critical issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="green">
          <p><strong>Visual Representation:</strong> To enhance clarity, we have used a color-coded system</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="red"></span> Red: Critical Risks</li>
            <li><span class="orange"></span> Orange: High Risks</li>
            <li><span class="yellow"></span> Yellow: Moderate Risks</li>
            <li><span class="green"></span> Green: No Significant Risks</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h5>Key Summary Findings and Recommendations:</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h6>Unpatched RDP Exposed to the Internet:</h6>
          <p><strong>Risk Level:</strong> Critical</p>
          <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Immediate patching of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), implementation of Network Level Authentication (NLA), and strengthening password policies.</p>
        </li>

        <!-- Repeat the structure for each scenario in the Executive Summary -->

      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Conclusion:</p>
    <p>While Artemis Inc. demonstrates the ability to patch and remediate vulnerabilities, the assessment reveals potential gaps in the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of existing processes. Unmitigated vulnerabilities, if exploited, can compromise the entire corporate network. Artemis Inc. is strongly urged to explore opportunities to enhance vulnerability and patch management strategies for comprehensive risk mitigation. This executive summary serves as a strategic compass for Artemis Inc.'s cybersecurity journey. The full list of vulnerabilities, along with comprehensive details and recommendations, is documented in the supplementary document.</p>
